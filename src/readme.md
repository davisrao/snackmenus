# overview
* App for cafe menu that houses drinks and snacks
* users can see menus and item details including recipe, ingredients

# tests
* run tests using `npm test`

# TODO: what would I do next?
* Refactor the code. One area of improvement would be making the menu state one piece of data rather than two separate things. Menu can be {snacks, drinks}
* Build additional tests
* Better message / error handling - redirect and flash a message on successful form submission
